- **Summary & Stats:** Reviewed dataset quality with distinct values, missing data, and summary statistics.
  
- **Pivot Tables:** Aggregated data by Segment, Country, and Product for deeper insights.
  
- **Dashboard:** Created charts for Sales, Profit, Discounts, and Segment-wise analysis using pivot visuals.
- 

###  SQL Analysis

- Queried cleaned dataset to extract insights.
- Used `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `WHERE`, and aggregate functions like `SUM()`, `AVG()`.
  
- Analyzed performance by:
  
  - Country and Segment
  - Monthly/Yearly Sales Trends
  - Profitability by Product
- Focused on data transformation and filtering to support business questions.

### Power BI Dashboard

- Built a fully interactive dashboard using:

  - **Bar & Line Charts** for trend and category comparisons
  - **KPI Cards** to show key metrics: Sales, Profit, Discounts
  - **Slicers** to filter data by Country, Year, Product, and Segment
- Enabled deep dive into business performance with clean visuals and drilldowns.
  

##  How to Run

1. **Excel** â€“ Open `Capstone_Project_Excel_File.xlsx` and explore sheets (`Cleaned Data`, `Pivot`, `Dashboard`).

3. **Power BI** â€“ Open `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop to interact with the dashboard.
